**Attention everyone,**
> I hereby declare the closure of the GrafenoGaGa project. We are about to launch a new collaborative project, which will be the biggest mod ever created for SmartGaGa, providing you with several possibilities.

> This version will be unique; We always sought to highlight SmartGaGa, and GrafenoGaGa allowed changes to the color and architecture of Android.

> In this version, there will be many more options, including new features that have not yet been revealed. We won't provide details for now, but we guarantee it will be worth it. We do not have an exact forecast for the release of this version. GrapheneGaGa is still available for use, however, stable. Some features may not work perfectly.

> Introducing SwanSync, the version that will revolutionize the stagnant SmartGaGa community. This version is aimed at the general community. We realize that a lot of people copied my interface and color files, but we won't be sorry about that. The emulator hasn't been active for a long time, so we're the ones keeping it alive. False modifiers, get ready, because even you will want to follow our example.
